Version v0.15.11 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

This release isn't ground breaking, but it is line breaking.
A major bug in our hyphenation algorithm went undetected for a long time because (by a virtue of a bug canceling out a bug) it didn't happen to affect English or Turkishâ€”far and away the most utilized languages in SILE's history.
But it did affect French, where [Didier Willis](http://github.com/Omikhleia) found and squashed it.
Hyphenation minima settings should be properly set for many other languages now and follow the current language.
Several languages also got hyphenation pattern updates.

In other minor details, length and measurement types no longer silently 'succeeds' when asked to parse non-compliant input.
Additionally disabling the (default on) `variablespaces` setting will actually take effect now and not continue to use any of the related settings in some contexts.
