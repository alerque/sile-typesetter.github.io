Version v0.15.10 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

This release brings yet another layer of improvements contributed by [Didier Willis](http://github.com/Omikhleia), especially to the bibliography and indexing features.
The bibliography system now uses CSL (Citation Style Language) by default, with enhanced support for grouped citations via `\cites`, better name formatting, and improved style compliance.
The indexer received significant upgrades including page range collapsing, customizable styling hooks, flexible placement in documents, and language-aware sorting.
Font handling saw improvements with new ex-height and cap-height adjustments, particularly benefiting code and verbatim text display.

The CLI also gained a new argument to streamline the process of loading 3rd party modules.
SILE has always found packages in specific system or relative locations easily, but setting the path to custom LuaRocks trees was not trivial.
A new `--luarocks-tree` argument should make it much simpler to match however you install with .

Other notable changes include avoiding hyphenation prior to page breaks, and fixes for various language-specific issues including Uyghur hyphenation and UTF-16 handling.
Warning messages involving unsupported languages should also make more sense and not spam the terminal over and over.
